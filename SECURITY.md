# Security Policy

This document outlines the security policy for the `markdown-template` repository
and provides instructions for reporting vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain and provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version            | Supported             |

For non-software repositories (e.g., documentation or templates), version-specific risks are not applicable.
However, any discovered vulnerabilities should still be reported promptly.
